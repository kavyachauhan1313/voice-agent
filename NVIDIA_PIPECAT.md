# NVIDIA Pipecat

The NVIDIA Pipecat library augments [the Pipecat framework](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat) by adding additional frame processors and NVIDIA services. This includes the integration of NVIDIA services and NIMs such as [Riva ASR](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/parakeet-ctc-1_1b-asr), [Riva TTS](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/magpie-tts-multilingual), [LLM NIMs](https://build.nvidia.com/models), [NAT (NeMo Agent Toolkit)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit), and [Foundational RAG](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/rag). It also introduces a few processors with a focus on improving the end-user experience for multimodal conversational agents, along with speculative speech processing to reduce latency for faster bot responses. 

The nvidia-pipecat source code can be found in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/voice-agent-examples).
